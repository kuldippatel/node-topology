#Approach 1(topo1.js): Get topology starting from any node.

###COMMANDS:
node topo1.js A

node topo1.js F

#This will print same topology starting executing from any node.



#Approach 2(topo2.js): Incremental topology building. Each node is actually running a server. New nodes become existing nodes' clients and print existing topology on thier side.
# working on fixing infinite loop
same commands with topo2.js
